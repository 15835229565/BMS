This is a breakout board for the BQ76940. This configuration allows for 15 cells to be read. There is no safety cut off.

This is a dangerous board that exposes the user to over 48VDC and many amps. Please use responsibly.

v1 of the board is functional. Firmware is working. Most functions are written. 

![BMS PCB Layout v2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nseidle/BMS/master/v2 Layout.jpg)

-> v2 of the board has full cutoff MOSFETs and charging MOSFETs. <-

![BMS Test Pack v1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nseidle/BMS/master/v1 Test Pack.jpg)

v1 of the test pack works but has multiple errors that are fixed on v2. Number labels on the cells are reversed. Cells 9 and 14 were shorted to bring the voltage back down to 48V. The clips are very close together so plastic insulators were glued in place.
